Hi, I’m <b>Will Conley</b> (@FluvGeo)
- I am a <b>geomorphologist</b> based in New Zealand with proficiency in fluvial and tectonic geomorphology, geoanlaytics, ecology, hydrology, hydraulics and data science!
- I have almost 30 years of decades of experience with <b>rivers and catchments</b>, mainly in restoration (nature based solutions, room for the river, working with rivers, etc.). 
- I have worked in <b>river management</b>, <b>design</b>, <b>construction</b>, and <b>research capacities</b>.
- My main interests are <b>rivers</b>, <b>geohazards</b>, and <b>landscape evolution</b>.
- I am a <b>lifetime learner</b> (having completed a PhD in multiscale morhodynamics in my mid-40s)...which is the great thing about rivers as you can never know it all. 
- I <b>code</b> mainly in Python, with bits of R, JS, and SQl.
- I’m looking to <b>collaborate</b> on any project that provides dual benefits to natural resources and public safety  
- I am best reached by email: will.conleyjr@wsp.com
